  - Event Properties (field validation)  
  - Input Sanitization Properties (malformed JSON & XSS)
  - Thread/Forum Properties (thread creation & voting)
  - Vital Signs Properties (numeric range validation)
  - Care Recipients Properties (required field validation)
  - Rate Limiting Properties (concurrent load handling)
