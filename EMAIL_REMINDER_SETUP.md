# Email Reminder System Integration - Complete Setup

## Overview
I've successfully integrated the email reminder feature from your backend/frontend folders into your main Nurtura project. The system will automatically send email reminders to `caregiverreminder@gmail.com` (from Settings) 1 hour before any scheduled calendar event.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Integration
- **EmailJS Service**: Added email functionality using your existing EmailJS credentials
- **User Settings API**: Created endpoints to manage user preferences including email settings
- **Event Model Updates**: Enhanced to track reminder status and settings
- **Cron Job**: Runs every 5 minutes to check for events needing reminders
- **Email Reminder Service**: Handles sending reminder emails 1 hour before events

### 2. Frontend Integration
- **Settings Page**: Now connects to backend to store/retrieve user preferences
- **Calendar Events**: Enhanced to support reminder functionality
- **Test Reminder**: Added "Test Reminder" button in calendar event edit mode

### 3. Database Models
- **Enhanced Event Model**: Added `reminderSent`, `reminderEmail`, `enableReminder` fields
- **New UserSettings Model**: Stores user preferences including email and notification settings

## How It Works

### Automatic Reminders
1. **Event Creation**: When you create an event in the calendar, it's automatically set for reminders
2. **Background Monitoring**: The server checks every 5 minutes for upcoming events
3. **Timing**: Reminders are sent when an event is 55-60 minutes away (1-hour window)
4. **Email Content**: Includes event title, date, time, and any notes/remarks
5. **Recipient**: Uses the email from Settings page (`caregiverreminder@gmail.com`)

### Manual Testing
- **Test Button**: In calendar, edit any event and click "Test Reminder" to send immediate test email
- **Settings Management**: Update email address in Settings page and it will be used for all reminders

## API Endpoints Added

- `GET /api/user-settings/:userId` - Get user settings
- `PUT /api/user-settings/:userId` - Update user settings  
- `POST /api/events/:id/send-reminder` - Manually trigger reminder for specific event

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (Already Set)
```
EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_cjxnfuw
EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_ktfl1fr
EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=EI8_XfkaJ1OMkGiSP
EMAILJS_PRIVATE_KEY=S8BXkMyxI5AtqYlQFmI53
```

### Server Status
- **Backend**: Running on http://localhost:5000
- **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:5173
- **Email System**: Active and monitoring for events
- **Cron Job**: Checking every 5 minutes

## Testing the System

### 1. Immediate Test
1. Go to Calendar page
2. Create or edit an event
3. Click "Test Reminder" button
4. Check `caregiverreminder@gmail.com` for test email

### 2. Automatic Test
1. Create an event scheduled for 1 hour from now
2. Wait up to 5 minutes (next cron check)
3. Check email for automatic reminder

### 3. Settings Test
1. Go to Settings page
2. Change email address
3. Save settings
4. Create test event - reminders will go to new email

## Key Features
- ✅ **Automatic Email Reminders**: 1 hour before events
- ✅ **User Settings Integration**: Email stored in user preferences
- ✅ **Test Functionality**: Manual reminder testing
- ✅ **Cron Scheduling**: Background monitoring every 5 minutes
- ✅ **Event Tracking**: Prevents duplicate reminders
- ✅ **Settings Persistence**: User preferences saved to database

## Next Steps
1. **Test the system** by creating events and checking emails
2. **Customize email template** in EmailJS dashboard if needed
3. **Adjust timing** by modifying the cron schedule in `emailReminderService.js`
4. **Add SMS reminders** by integrating a service like Twilio
5. **Enhance notifications** with push notifications for web/mobile

The system is now fully operational and ready to send email reminders for your calendar events!
